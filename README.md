# Broca's Area
Broca's area or the Broca area /broʊˈkɑː/ or /ˈbroʊkə/ is a region in the frontal lobe of the dominant hemisphere (usually the left) of the hominid brain with functions linked to speech production. In other words, this is what allows [Matilda](http://matilda.edwardleoni.com/) to talk.

Or in a more generic and boring definition, this is a Python micro-service capable of receiving text and turn into speech by using AWS Polly.
